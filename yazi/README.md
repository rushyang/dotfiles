- **`package.toml`** - Specifies plugins to enhance Yaziâ€™s functionality.
- **`theme.toml`** - Customizes Yaziâ€™s appearance and color scheme.
- **`yazi.toml`** - The main configuration file that controls Yaziâ€™s behavior.

## Getting Started
To set up Yazi with this configuration, follow these steps:

1. **Install Yazi**
   - Follow the official [installation guide](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/installation) to install Yazi on your system. Do not forget to follow original instructions of Shell Wrapper from [Quick Start](https://yazi-rs.github.io/docs/quick-start#shell-wrapper).

2. **Clone Just the Yazi Directory from the Dotfiles Repository**
   If your repository contains multiple configurations and you only want the Yazi directory, use:
   ```sh
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/rushyang/dotfiles.git
   cd dotfiles
   git sparse-checkout set yazi
   mv yazi ~/.config/yazi
   ```
   This ensures that only the `yazi` directory is cloned and moved into the correct location.

3. **Install Plugins from `package.toml`**
   ```sh
   ya install -i
   ```
   This will install all plugins listed in `package.toml`.

4. **(Optional) Update Plugins**
   ```sh
   ya install -u
   ```
   This updates all installed plugins to their latest versions.

5. **Launch Yazi**
   ```sh
   y
   ```
   You are now ready to use Yazi with this configuration!
